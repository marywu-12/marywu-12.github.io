Hey there! I am a first-year Master's student in [Statistics & Data Science](https://statistics.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University. I hold a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Economics & Mathematics from New York University, with a minor in Music. I'm particularly interested in how advancements in technology could transform business decision-making, and I'm currently working under the supervision of [Prof. Bernard Yeung](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/bernardyyeung.html) to investigate the impact of AI-driven technologies on firms' foreign expansion. Most recently, I am exploring Bayesian statistics and am honored to have been instructed by [Prof. Martin Tanner](https://statistics.northwestern.edu/people/in-memoriam/martin-tanner.html), who sparked my interest in the field and will be missed by many. 

I am actively looking for part-time jobs and summer 2025 internships, particularly in data-related positions within the financial services, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology industries. My resume can be found [here](./assets/Mary_Wu_resume.pdf). If you know of any opportunities or would like to connect, please feel free to reach out to me! 

In my free time, I am either [dancing](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTtwOyXty5KrBILfYxhCcgQkDOWCKc7O4&si=J7n9ydpSPswdH8dg), [playing the piano](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTtwOyXty5Ko6EUtSugRxdR_8hsD30817&si=z_aScmD2JXHh8V3i) or [arranging pop songs](https://musescore.com/user/36638079) (perfect pitch comes in handy here). 

Feel free to contact me about statistics, music, fun facts, or anything that you want to share. Together, we can uncover more truths about the world :)
