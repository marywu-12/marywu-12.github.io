Hello! I am a first-year Master's student in [Statistics & Data Science](https://statistics.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University. I hold a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Economics & Mathematics from [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), with a minor in Music. 

I'm particularly interested in how advancements in technology could transform business decision-making, and I'm currently working under the supervision of [Prof. Bernard Yeung](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/bernardyyeung.html) to investigate the impact of AI-driven technologies on firms' foreign expansion. Most recently, I am exploring Bayesian statistics and am honored to have been instructed by [Prof. Martin Tanner](https://statistics.northwestern.edu/people/in-memoriam/martin-tanner.html), who sparked my interest in the field. 

In my free time, I am either [dancing](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTtwOyXty5KrBILfYxhCcgQkDOWCKc7O4&si=J7n9ydpSPswdH8dg), [playing the piano](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTtwOyXty5Ko6EUtSugRxdR_8hsD30817&si=z_aScmD2JXHh8V3i) or [arranging pop songs](https://musescore.com/user/36638079). 

Feel free to contact me about statistics, music, or anything that you want to share. Together, we can uncover more truths about the world :)

ðŸ“£: I am actively looking for **part-time jobs** and **summer 2025 internships** in data-related positions, ideally within financial services, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology. My resume can be found [here](Mary_Wu_resume.pdf). If you know of any opportunities or would like to connect, please feel free to reach out to me!
